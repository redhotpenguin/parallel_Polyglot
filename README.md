# The Parallel Polygot

This repository is for experienced programmers who spend time working with multiple programming languages. It shows syntax for different languages grouped by common topics (conditionals, loops, etc).

If you are reading this, you probably know one or two languages fluently, and several others proficiently. Context switching between them and remembering exact syntax can be difficult, even for the best of us. There are a small number of folks out there have all the syntax from all the languages in their head already. I hope to be one of those lucky few one day, but right now I need a reference guide to help me get there.

I hope this document helps you as much as it does me. You'll notice the name of this repository is a mix of under_score and camelCase syntax; that's intentional. Naming conventions for different languages are observed.

1. [Hello World](/helloworld)
